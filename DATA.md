# Data notes

## run1-data
Partial run, bugs in the model caused some steps not to be run. Data is probably invalid.  

**social run**  
`settings.socialswitchprobability = 0.01`  
`settings.randomswitchprobability = 0.05`  

**asocial run**  
`settings.socialswitchprobability = 0.00`  
`settings.randomswitchprobability = 1.0`  


## run2-data
Agents in trial group are social some of the time and asocial the rest  
Agents in the control group are only asocial  

**social run**  
`settings.socialswitchprobability = 0.07`  
`settings.randomswitchprobability = 0.01`  

**asocial run**  
`settings.socialswitchprobability = 0.00`  
`settings.randomswitchprobability = 1.0`  

## run3-data
Agents in the trial group are social most of the time and rarely asocial.  
Agents in the control group are only asocial  

**social run**
